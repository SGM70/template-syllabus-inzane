Inzane Syllabus

Original description:

A modern, edgy, and sleek syllabus template for those who are bored of the standard black-and-white syllabi all too common in college classrooms.

This syllabus was created for a specific purpose: my graduate school qualifying exams. Because of that, it is missing a lot of the usual sections and the schedule is non-standard. I am more than happy to help modify it to fit your specific requirements and tastes.

(Adapted based on the TwentySeconds CV template)
